As I was building [API-Fiddle.com](https://api-fiddle.com), I found myself on the hunt for a solid markdown editor. 
I was specifically looking for a text editor replacement—something simple yet powerful enough to handle markdown 
without requiring an entire document editor like Notion or Obsidian.

I didn’t think it would be hard to find the right tool, but to my surprise, it wasn’t as straightforward as I had 
hoped. The editors I came across could mostly be divided into two categories:

1. **Full document editing** (think Notion, Obsidian, or Google Docs with markdown support).
2. **Textarea replacements** that bring simple markdown editing into your React projects.

In this post, I’ll share my experiences and the tools I evaluated. While I was primarily looking for a 
simple textarea replacement, the limited options out there led me to this breakdown. If you're in a similar 
position, this might save you some time.

### Full Document Editing

If you’re looking for a complete document editing experience with markdown (similar to Notion or Obsidian), these 
are two noteworthy contenders:

- **[Vrite](https://github.com/vriteio/vrite)**: A powerful tool that aims to provide a full-featured writing 
experience for markdown-based workflows.
- **[Lexical](https://github.com/facebook/lexical)**: A rich text editor built by Facebook, offering plenty of 
customization options and solid markdown support.

Although both tools are great for heavy-lifting document editing, I was more focused on finding a simpler 
textarea replacement for my needs.

### Textarea Replacements: Markdown Editors I Tried

## React MD Editor

This was one of the first editors I tried. Here are my takeaways:

- **Ease of use**: It’s fast to get started with React-MD-Editor. It does a good job rendering text in raw 
markdown.
- **Customization limitations**: It doesn’t provide a rich editing experience beyond basic markdown support. 
Customizing it is difficult—you’ll have to wrestle with overwriting hardcoded styles using deeply specific CSS selectors.
- **Performance hit**: React-MD-Editor increases your bundle size by around **2MB** (before compression), 
which is significant for such a simple editor.
- **Conclusion**: While it's a functional markdown editor, it lacks the flexibility and ease of customization needed 
for a professional application like API-Fiddle.

## MDX Editor

Next, I explored **MDX Editor**, which took a different approach with its hybrid model:

- **Rich editing + source mode**: It lets you toggle between a rich editor and a raw markdown source mode. 
This sounded ideal at first, but it has quirks.
- **Escaping issues**: Typing basic markdown like `*word*` for bold works, but entering `[link](url)` 
escapes the markdown tokens rather than rendering them as expected. This also complicates code pasting.
- **Customization pain points**: Despite its rich feature set, modifying the editor is tough, especially 
for customizing key parts like the link dialog.
- **Bundle size**: Again, this editor adds multiple MBs to your bundle.
- **Conclusion**: It's a decent hybrid, but the escaping and customization challenges held me back from 
fully adopting it.

## Tiny Markdown Editor and React-SimpleMDE-Editor

[Tiny-Markdown-Editor](https://github.com/jefago/tiny-markdown-editor)
[React-SimpleMDE-Editor](https://react-simplemde-edtior.netlify.app/)

Both of these tools fell into a similar trap:

- **Customization struggles**: Just like React-MD-Editor, customizing these tools required a fight with CSS specificity.
- **Syntax highlighting**: It has built-in support for things like code blocks, but again, customizing the look and feel is far from simple.
- **Maintenance issues**: The project feels somewhat abandoned, and I wasn't confident about its long-term reliability.

## What’s Next?

After spending a lot of time evaluating these tools, I was left with no perfect solution. None of the existing markdown 
editors gave me a production-ready, professional experience in React.

That’s why I’m now leaning towards building my own markdown editor using **Lexical** from Facebook. While Lexical 
is not a markdown-first solution, it offers flexibility and is actively maintained by a team that ensures long-term 
stability—something that’s hard to come by in the markdown editor space.

If you’re in the market for a markdown editor and want more than just a quick hack, investing time in customizing 
Lexical could be worth it. It requires effort, but it’s likely the best option given the current state of markdown editors for React.

If you’ve found a markdown editor that worked well for you, let me know! I’m always on the lookout for better tools, 
and maybe we can help each other out in this search.
